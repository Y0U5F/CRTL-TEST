  - Specify columns, data types, and constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
  - Follow normalization rules to minimize redundancy.
  - Document schema in `docs/schema.txt`.
- **Design Database Objects**:
  - Plan stored procedures, e.g., `SP_AddQuestion`, `SP_CreateExam`.
  - Design functions, e.g., for validating text answers using regular expressions.
  - Plan triggers for data integrity, e.g., ensuring exam degrees donâ€™t exceed course max degree.
  - Design views for reporting, e.g., student exam results.
- **Plan User Roles and Permissions**:
  - Define four roles: Admin, Training Manager, Instructor, Student.
  - Specify permissions, e.g., Instructors can only access their course data.

- **Implement Indexes**:
  - Add indexes on frequently queried columns, e.g., `CourseID`, `StudentID`.
- **Write Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers, Views**:
  - Each team member writes their assigned objects in their own script file, e.g., `sql/team_members/member1.sql`.
  - Example stored procedure for adding a question:
    ```sql
    -- Author: Member1
    -- Description: Add a question to the question pool
    CREATE PROCEDURE SP_AddQuestion
        @QuestionText NVARCHAR(MAX),
        @QuestionType NVARCHAR(50),
        @CorrectAnswer NVARCHAR(MAX),
        @CourseID INT
    AS
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO tbl_Questions (QuestionText, QuestionType, CorrectAnswer, CourseID)
        VALUES (@QuestionText, @QuestionType, @CorrectAnswer, @CourseID);
    END;
    ```
  - Implement functions for text answer validation using regex.
  - Create triggers to enforce data integrity, e.g., checking exam degree limits.
  - Create views for easy data retrieval, e.g., exam results by student.
- **Set Up User Accounts and Permissions**:
  - Create SQL Server users for each role.
  - Grant specific permissions, e.g., `GRANT EXECUTE ON SP_CreateExam TO InstructorRole;`.

**Trello**:
- Create cards in "Implementation" list, e.g., "Implement Courses table."

- **GitHub**:
  - Write clear commit messages, e.g., "Added SP_CreateExam procedure."
  - Use branches for major features if needed, but keep it simple for small teams.
  - Avoid conflicts by assigning specific functionalities to team members (e.g., one handles exam creation, another handles student management).
- **SQL Development**:
  - Use transactions in stored procedures to ensure data integrity.
  - Handle errors with TRY-CATCH blocks.
  - Test text question validation thoroughly, as regex can be complex.
- **Team Collaboration**:
  - Communicate regularly via Trello comments or meetings.
  - Review each otherâ€™s SQL scripts to catch errors early.

## Potential Challenges
- **Schema Design**: Ensuring no redundancy while meeting all requirements.
- **Text Question Validation**: Implementing accurate regex or text functions for grading.
